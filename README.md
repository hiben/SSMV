Super Simple MPO Viewer

This small Java application allows you to load and view Multi Picture Object (MPO) files that
store a pair of images for stereographic viewing.
The MPO format (two JPEGs in one file) is used by various stereo cameras and the 3DS device from Nintendo.

Currently the application supports cross- and wall-eyed viewing for presenting the image pairs. Recently
'wiggle'-stereo was added where the images quickly alternate. The quality of the effect strongly depends on the 
image...
A last option is now anaglyph stereo with configurable filter colors (well... red, green or blue on the one side...)
and as a bonus you can save the anaglyph image to disk.

Planned features: image scaling to fit window
